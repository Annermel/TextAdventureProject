# Text Adventure

A text adventure game that is yet unnamed and will hopefully become a huge project.

## V2.2 Refactor

In this release, I'll attempt to adjust tile creation to allow items and features to be auto-loaded from the JSON - with the intention of making the app more scalable and easier to maintain. Current setup is enough to begin creating new story elements.

### Feature Wish List (Potentially Difficult)

- [ ] Implement lock and key system
- [ ] Implement item combinations

## V2.1 Refactor

This version is primarily focused on restructuring files for ease of comprehension. Focus is on code readability and compartmentalization of data.

### Finished This Release

- Converted data files to JSON
- Altered file structure for better readability
- Altered printing function to allow for optional alignment flag in first character

## V2 Refactor

This refactor includes a variety of updates to the class system that will allow for more flexibility and scalability, as well as more interesting interactions for the user.

### Still Under Development

- [ ] Expand story - only tutorial is implemented
- [x] Refactor the way that stories are stored
