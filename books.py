Alice asked the Cheshire Cat, who was sitting in a tree,

When you come out of the grips of a depression there is an
incredible relief, but not one you feel allowed to celebrate.
Instead, the feeling of victory is replaced with anxiety that
it will happen again, and with shame and vulnerability when
you see how your illness affected your family, your work,
everything left untouched while you struggled to survive.

Sometimes monsters are invisible, and
sometimes demons attack you from the inside.
Just because you cannot see the claws and the teeth
does not mean they aren’t ripping through me.
Pain does not need to be seen to be felt.
