  "Bedroom": """You wake up to a loud blaring sound, just like any other day. Reaching over, you turn off your alarm, and are plunged into a comforting silence.

Rubbing the sleep from your eyes, you look around the dark room before you. The curtains on the east wall are drawn tight, preventing any sunlight from entering. In one corner you can just about make out a pile of laundry on the floor. In the other corner, you know there is a bookshelf, although you can't see it. You welcome the darkness.

Somewhere nearby, you can hear a faint but steady tapping. You live alone. You listen harder and the tapping ceases.

There is a door to the north that leads to your living room.

""",
  "Living Room": """You're standing in your living room. You hear the strange tapping again, louder this time. Is it coming from inside your apartment?

There is a coffee table in the middle of the room with a pile of mail and some dirty dishes. You're not sure how long they've been there. 

To the south is the bedroom you just came from.
To the north is the door to the hallway outside your apartment. It fills you with dread.
To the west is your kitchen. When was the last time you ate? The days are starting to blur together.
To the east is your bathroom. You don't need to go right now.
